Becoming a mommy was always in the plan. However, this blessing came as a complete surprise to me.
The weekend before we found out about the pregnancy we had a few friends over, who ultimately became
the god parents to our daughter. While they were over we did what typical couple friends do, "girl-time"
and "guy-time". Lord only knows what the guys talk about. Yet, we all know that women can talk about
any, and everything in such a short amount of time. I am not too sure how we arrived to the topic of
having children, but me and my friend Rena ended up discussing our "readiness" for children. Now, I don't
  really remember her answer, but mine was pretty humerous. I remember telling her that "we were not ready for kids uet"
It makes me giggle even thinking about that, because the entire time I had nooo idea that I was already pregnant.

<h3>Finding out</h3>
<p>
  While our guests were over we went out to eat at a variety of places, some of which are my absolute favorite places to ear.
    Yet, I recall not having much of an apetite. Not only that, but I was extremely exhausted throughout the day. I took this as
    maybe I was catching a cold, in the middle of May. SO I did what any young women on their parent's health insurance does, and I
    went to the ER. While there, for what seemed like hours, I had to explain my symptoms multiple times to different people. When the
    doctor finally came in and I told him my story for the 100th time, he smiled and requested that I take a pregnancy test. I am
    glad he thought it was a joke as much as I did seeing as though my period had just went off and I was getting ready for my
    next round of birth control. Knowing this, I happily obliged.

      About an hour later, I hear a nurse in the hallway yell "We need more pregnancy tests". Meanwhile, I am in the room excited for
      whoever it was who was soon to find out they were pregant. A few minutes later the doctor strolls back in and tells me that
        needs to pull up my chart. Without a care in the world, I waited for him to login to the computer. Before the compute could even
        warm up, he turns to me and says "congratulations, you are going to be a mommy." He said it with so much joy and excitement that
      he did not even realize that he totally took my breathe away. I was sitting there, utterly still and breatheless as I processed this
      new information.

      My partner, Erikson was completely estatic. He went from dancing, to crying tears of joy. I hated to take this happy moment away
from him, but this was just not how I planned my life to be.

<h3>The first trimester</h3>
<p>
  The first trimester, which some may consider the worst of the three, went by pretty smoothe. I did not have too much morning sickness as I
  was not eating much anyways. I did experience a lot of highs and lows in my mood, as well as in my body temperature. It was the begining of summer at this
  point and I did not even want to leave the house. Extreme fatigue, to the point where I was unable to even move out of bed, hit like a ton of bricks. While, not
  completely terrible my first trimester was a huge lifestyle change for me. However, coping with the pregnancy was the hardest hurdle for me to get over.
  A few days after finding out I began to get more excited about my pregnancy, but was not ready to tell anyone yet.
  That is the scarist part, right. As if I am not a grown adult at an age and stage in her life where having a child is completely normal, if not,
expected from my family and friends. I knew I had to tell my mom first as I have always been a bad liar, and I knew she would find out anyways. It was not until the second trimester that
I told anyone else. Being raised in the church, we knew better than to get pregnant before marriage. While, no one would say anything directly to your face, I was raised to know that doing
so was highly frowned upone. I expected my family to be so disappointed in my, but they were not even close to disappointed. Everyone was so excited, as if they were waiting their entire
lives for me to have a baby. This was surprising, yet exciting for me and exactly what I needed to become more comfortable with the pregnancy.

<h3>The Second Trimester</h3>
<p>
  Also, known as the best trimester was when things began to look up for me. I was so excited to become a mommy that I began talking to my belly every chance that I got. When I woke up in the morning,
  in the shower, during my commute to work, during bathroom trips... People must've thought that I was completely insane but in my mind my baby was my best friend. I mean, what else did she have to
  inside of my belly other than develop and listen to me talk all day.
    During this we told our closest friends and family about the pregnancy. All were extremely excited and began guessing the gender of my baby. Somehow, I knew very early on that I would have a baby girl. I
    always had dreams about her, and something in my gut just let me know. I felt extremely connected to my baby to the point where I did not have to speak to communicate with her. I could just close my eyes
    and connect with her. I could calm her down when I was feeling stressed, or get her to move just by connecting with her.
      Around the 20 week mark was when we would find out the gender. Always wanting to do a gender reveal, I opted out of learning the gender during the ultrasount.
